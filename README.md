### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ["cursed" code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyAGjU8imb8). ```let a: i32 = 'a"``` 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to escape Microsoft.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [Roblox](https://now.gg/apps/roblox-corporation/5349/roblox.html) Studio.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with depression.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about [Roblox](https://duckduckgo.com/l/?uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Froblox%2Fid431946152&rut=dd08b42eec7f2842f3441415b4d54eceb875ead8bbed5c77ac3f1eeef118d9f6).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: By tapping me on the shoulder.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ASUHDiusadfhs/fdsuygfsduifds (I used super complicated AI to generate this) (not *that* hard to pronounce) (so please pronounce it well) (thanks).
- ASSEMBLY, [C--](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C--), C++ (Rust--), Java, Cobolt, Go, Ruby-off-rails  (I still need to practice Ruby).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to write a lot of stuff. I definitely don't use AI for it. :winky-face:
